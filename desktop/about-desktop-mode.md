# About Desktop Mode

Desktop mode runs PowerShell Universal as a desktop application. It installs to the current user's application data folders and does not require administrative access to run. It runs as the current user and with a tray icon to access the console and configuration files.&#x20;

## Install Desktop Mode

To install desktop mode, you can [download ](https://ironmansoftware.com/downloads)the desktop mode installer from our website.&#x20;

## Differences in Desktop Mode

Desktop mode runs slightly differently than PowerShell Universal as a service.

### Application Context

The desktop application uses WebView2 to display the PowerShell Universal admin console within the application window. The PowerShell Universal server integrates with the desktop application to provide desktop-specific features based on the configuration of PSU.&#x20;

The desktop application provides a tray icon that can be used to exit PowerShell Universal, view the admin UI and open the configuration folder in VS Code.&#x20;

PowerShell Universal will not run when the user is not logged in so scheduled jobs will not execute.&#x20;

### Configuration

Configuration files are stored in `%AppData%\PowerShellUniversal` rather than the ProgramData folder. You can quickly access the configuration folder by using the PowerShell Universal tray icon.&#x20;

### Dashboards

Desktop mode does not support PowerShell Universal Dashboard v2 frameworks. It actually doesn't support anything except the latest framework version. It will not deploy copies of the framework.&#x20;

### Security&#x20;

Desktop mode runs as the current user as a regular desktop application. It starts the PowerShell Universal web server. The server only listens on localhost. You will not be able to change security settings for the server.&#x20;
