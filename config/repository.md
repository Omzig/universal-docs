# Repository

The configuration data for PowerShell Universal is primarily stored within the repository. By default, the repository folder can be found in `%ProgramData%\UniversalAutomation\Repository`. You can adjust the location of the repository by editing the `appsettings.json` file.&#x20;

The repository contains PowerShell scripts and XML files that are produced when using the PowerShell Universal admin console. The repository folder is also watched for changes so any change made on disk will cause the system to reload the file and reconfigure the platform. When using Git integration, the repository folder is what is synchronized with the git remote.&#x20;

All configuration cmdlets are part of the [Universal ](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Universal)module.

## What's Stored in the Repository

Files stored in the repository are stored as plain text to allow for easy differencing with source control tools.&#x20;

* Authentication
* Dashboards
* Endpoints
* Environments
* Licenses
* Login Pages
* Pages
* Published Folders
* Rate Limits
* Roles
* Schedules
* Scripts
* Settings
* Tags
* Triggers

## What's Not Stored in the Repository

These entities are stored within the PowerShell Universal database.&#x20;

* App Tokens
* Identities
* Job History

## Editing the Repository

You can edit the repository files directly in the admin console by navigating to Settings \ Configurations. The editor allows you to create files and folders and edit any file within the repository directory.&#x20;

## Custom Configuration Script

A custom configuration script can be executed within the configuration process. The path to the configuration script can be defined in `appsettings.json` or as an environment variable.&#x20;

{% code title="appsettings.json" %}
```json
"Data": {
    "ConfigurationScript": "customScript.ps1"
}
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Environment Variable" %}
```powershell
$Env:Data__ConfigurationScript = "customScript.ps1"
```
{% endcode %}

You can chose to return items such as endpoints, scripts or dashboards from the script. Additionally, you can use this script to configure resources like modules and secret vaults before the system is started. The custom configuration script is run before any other configuration scripts.&#x20;

## Read-Only Configuration Sections

Read-Only sections allow you to include script in your configuration files that will not be touched by changes in the admin console. This allows you to run additional logic, generate resources dynamically and create classes for use in OpenAPI schemas.&#x20;

The `PSUHeader` region is placed at the top of your script. `PSUFooter` is placed at the bottom.

```powershell
#region PSUHeader 

1..100 | ForEach-Object {
    New-PSUEndpoint -Url "/endpoint/$_" -Endpoint {

    }
}

#endregion

New-PSUEndpoint -Url "/user" -Endpoint {

}

#region PSUFooter
#endregion
```
