DESCRIPTION
    This date and time component is used for formatting dates and times using the user's browser settings. Since Universal Dashboard PowerShell scripts run within the server, the date and time settings of the user's system are not taken into account. This component formats date and time within the client's browser to take into account their locale and time zone.
