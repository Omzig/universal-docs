  Counters

# Monitoring

PowerShell Universal automatically integrates with Microsoft Application Insights to provide monitoring and alerting for your system. It also provides performance counters for various features in the environment.&#x20;

## Application Insights

### Configuring Application Insights

Within the Azure Portal, you will need to create a new Application Insights resource. Once it's been created, you will need to copy the instrumentation key.

Next, paste your instrumentation key into the [Settings file ](../config/settings.md)for PowerShell Universal. Finally, restart the PowerShell Universal server. Application monitoring will now be enabled.

```
  "ApplicationInsights": {
    "InstrumentationKey": "73b84b67-6fc9-4c37-9f54-000000000000"
  },
```

If you are running PowerShell Universal in Azure, you can also create a new Application Setting. Within your web app, click Configuration and the n Click New application setting.&#x20;

The name should be:

```
APPLICATIONINSIGHTS__INSTRUMENTATIONKEY
```

The value should be the instrumentation key. Restart your web app to start collecting metrics.

### Viewing Monitoring Data

Within the Azure Portal, you can view the Application Insights resource to view information about your PowerShell Universal server. This will include data such as failed responses, server response time, server requests and availability. You'll also be able to setup alerts to monitor for particular conditions of the PowerShell Universal server.

## Performance Counters

{% hint style="info" %}
Performance counters are only supported on Windows.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Performance counters are installed when running the MSI installer. Once this occurs, performance data will automatically be generated by the following counters.&#x20;

* PowerShell Universal \ Active API Endpoints \ \_Total
* PowerShell Universal \ Active API Endpoints \ Endpoint&#x20;
* PowerShell Universal \ API Endpoint Calls per Second \ \_Total
* PowerShell Universal \ API Endpoint Calls per Second \ Endpoint
* PowerShell Universal \ API Execution Time \ \_Total
* PowerShell Universal \ API Execution Time \ Endpoint
* PowerShell Universal \ Active Dashboard Connections \ \_Total
* PowerShell Universal \ Active Dashboard Connections \ Dashboard

## Processes

Processes started directly from PowerShell Universal will be displayed in the processes page. You can access this page by click Home and then the Processes card.&#x20;

Information includes the process ID, purpose, file name, and memory usage. You can also view the state of runspaces within the process.&#x20;
